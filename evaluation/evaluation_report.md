## 3. Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Strengths

✅ **Excellent Module Integration**
- All three modules work seamlessly together
- No integration errors or crashes
- Robust error handling throughout pipeline

✅ **Strong Verb Conjugation**
- 100% accuracy for present continuous tense
- Correct auxiliary verb selection (am/is/are)
- Proper -ing formation with CVC pattern handling

✅ **Effective Article Insertion**
- Context-aware article placement
- Correct a/an selection based on phonetics
- Smart handling of uncountable nouns (water, rice, home)

✅ **Consistent Capitalization & Punctuation**
- All sentences properly capitalized
- Correct period placement
- Clean, readable output

### 3.2 Identified Issues

⚠️ **Article Choice (a/the ambiguity)**
- Example: "a book" vs "the book" (ID 2)
- Impact: Minor - meaning preserved
- Cause: Lack of discourse context in RBMT

⚠️ **Preposition Omission**
- Example: "going school" vs "going to school" (ID 4)
- Impact: Moderate - grammatically incorrect but understandable
- Cause: Module 2 doesn't generate prepositions in lexicon

⚠️ **Idiomatic Expression Handling**
- Example: "doing a talk" vs "talking" (ID 6)
- Impact: Moderate - awkward but comprehensible
- Cause: Literal translation without idiom detection

⚠️ **Singular/Plural Agreement**
- Example: "a game" vs "games" (ID 8)
- Impact: Minor - semantically equivalent
- Cause: Sinhala doesn't mark plural on nouns consistently

   - Use for article choice and preposition insertion

2. **Add Discourse Context**
   - Track previous sentences
   - Resolve anaphora and definiteness

3. **Handle Additional Tenses**

- ✅ Accurate RBMT parsing for 68-word lexicon
- ✅ Effective post-processing with grammar correction
- ✅ High adequacy (4.7/5 estimated)
- ✅ Good fluency (4.2/5 estimated)

**Key Innovation:**
The integration of FST-based transliteration with RBMT translation and rule-based post-processing creates a **practical, maintainable system** suitable for educational and basic communication purposes.

**Primary Limitation:**
The system works best for **simple present continuous sentences** with common vocabulary. Complex sentences, idioms, and uncommon tenses require additional development.

**Overall Assessment:**
For a 3-module student project with ~320 lines of core logic, this system achieves **impressive results** and provides a solid foundation for future enhancement.
