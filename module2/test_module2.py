# TODO: Implement test harness
# Steps:
# 1. Import the translate function from module2
# 2. Load corpus.json from parent directory
# 3. For each item in corpus:
#    - Run: actual_dict = translate(item['sinhala'])
#    - Create expected output dictionary based on reference
#    - Assert key values (raw_translation, subject, verb, object)
#    - Print: PASS or FAIL with details
# 4. Print final summary with pass/fail count
